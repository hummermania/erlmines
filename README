This project is to run a Minetest Server using Erlang, mainly hoping to improve server quality and stability. In time this project will allow hundreds of players connected to one server, rather than the current technical limitations of the minetestserver program provided by celeron55's minetest GitHub repo.

This project should be under GPL V2 (or later.)

This project is still being worked out, until a working server module is completed.

The code is worked and created upon by HumerMania.

The game, Minetest is worked and maintained by Celeron55, aka, Perttu Ahola. The repo for Minetest is https://github.com/celeron55/minetest and the extended version of it can be found here: http://github.com/celeron55/minetest_game
